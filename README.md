<h1>Employee Payroll System</h1>
<p>This is a very basic Java project that helps in grasping the various concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java like INCAPSULATION, ABSTRACTION, POLYMORPHISM and INHERITANCE etc. This Project keeps the track of Employees and their salaries depending upon whether they are Full-Time Employees or Part-Time Employees. </p>
